# KPPTR-hardware

Welcome to the KPPTR-hardware repository! This repository contains the design files for the hardware components used in the KPPTR project. The design files have been created using KiCad 6.0, a powerful open-source electronics design automation suite.

## Project Overview

The design files in this repository correspond to the hardware components that make up the KPPTR project, which enhances the capabilities of DIY amateur rockets and high-altitude balloons. The design files have been crafted using KiCad 6.0, a popular and user-friendly tool for creating electronic schematics and PCB layouts. Both hardware and sofware were developed by PTR member!

## Design Files

The repository includes design files for the various hardware components used in the KPPTR project, including:

- **Schematics**: Detailed electronic schematics that illustrate the connections and components used in the design.
- **PCB Layouts**: PCB layout designs that define the placement and routing of components on the printed circuit board.
- **Libraries**: Custom component libraries and footprints used in the project.

## Getting Started

To access and work with the design files, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install [KiCad 6.0](https://www.kicad.org/download/) if you haven't already.
3. Open the KiCad project files (`.pro` files) in the appropriate subdirectories to access the schematics and PCB layouts.

Feel free to explore the design files and customize them to suit your specific needs. If you make any improvements or modifications to the hardware designs, consider contributing back to the repository to help the community.
